    <h3>Description</h3><br>
    <p>Win someone over with this creamy chicken casserole. It's a great family meal served with mash, or new potatoes, and green beans</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain flour</li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Chilli flakes</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Double cream</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour on a plate and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Coat the chicken in the flour.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the sundried tomato oil in a large, lidded frying pan over a medium heat and fry the chicken for 8-10 mins until golden all over, but not cooked through. Set the chicken aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the remaining 1 tbsp sundried tomato oil into the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. Fry the onion for 8-10 mins until softened but not golden. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute before adding the sundried tomatoes, chilli and thyme or oregano, stirring well.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back to the pan, then pour over the cream and chicken stock, and season well. Put the lid on the pan and cook on medium-low for about 20 mins, turning the chicken halfway through until it is cooked through and the sauce has thickened a little. Stir in the parmesan, then serve with a scattering of basil leaves and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
